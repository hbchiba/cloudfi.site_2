                <p>By using the Site, you agree that we can use the cookies described in this Cookie Policy. You can stop

                <p class="bold">WHAT ARE COOKIES?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which are downloaded to your browsing device
                    (such as a
                    computer or smartphone) when you visit a website. Cookies can be recognized by the website that downloaded
                    them — or
                    other websites that use the same cookies. This helps websites know if the browsing device has visited them
                    before.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="bold">WHAT ARE COOKIES USED FOR?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how the Site is being used, letting you
                    navigate between
                    pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your browsing experience. Cookies can
                    also help
                    ensure marketing you see online is more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
                <p>We use cookies to recognize your browser or device, learn more about your interests, and provide you with
                    essential
                    features and services and for additional purposes, including:</p>

                <p class="bold">WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE?</p>
                <br>
                <p>The type of cookies used on most websites can generally be put into one of six categories: <span class="bold">Strictly
                        Necessary,
                        Performance, Functionality, Flash, Tailored Content and Targeting</span>. In order to provide you with the
                    best
                    browsing
                    experience, CloudFi uses the cookies from all of the above-mentioned categories on the Site. You can find out
                    more about
                    each cookie category in the sections below.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p class="bold">Strictly Necessary Cookies:</p>
                <br>
                <p>These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around the Site and use its features, such as
                    accessing secure
                    areas. Without these cookies, some services you have asked for such as payment submission can’t be provided.
                </p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p class="bold">Performance Cookies:</p>
                <br>
                <p>These cookies collect information about how you use the Site, for example which pages you go to most often
                    and if you
                    get error messages from certain pages. These cookies don’t gather information that identifies you. All
                    information these
                    cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how the Site works.
                </p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p class="bold">Functionality Cookies:</p>
                <br>
                <p>These cookies allow the Site to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region
                    you’re in).
                    For instance, the Site uses functionality cookies to remember your region preference. These cookies can also
                    be used to
                    remember changes you’ve made to text size, font and other parts of pages that you can customize. The
                    information these
                    cookies collect may be anonymous and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.

                <br>
                <p class="bold">Flash Cookies:</p>
                <br>
                <p>We may, in certain circumstances, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips or
                    animation.
                    To improve your user experience, Local Shared Objects (commonly known as "Flash cookies") are employed to
                    provide
                    functions such as remembering your settings and preferences. Flash cookies are stored on your device, but they
                    are
                    managed through an interface different from the one provided by your web browser. This means it is not
                    possible to
                    manage Flash cookies through your browser in the same way you would normally manage cookies. Instead, you can
                    access
                    your Flash management tools from Adobe’s website at <a class="link" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>.

                <p class="bold">Tailored Content Cookies:</p>
                <br>
                <p>Tailored content cookies help the Site provide enhanced features and display content in a way that is
                    relevant to you.
                    These cookies help the Site determine what information to show you based on how you have used the Site
                    previously. These
                    cookies do not track your browsing activity on other websites.

                <br>
                <br>
                <p class="bold">Targeting Cookies:</p>
                <br>
                <p>These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. They are
                    also used to
                    limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising
                    campaign.
                    They remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other organizations such
                    as
                    advertisers. This means after you have been to the Site you may see some advertisements about our services
                    elsewhere on
                    the Internet.

                <p class="bold">HOW LONG WILL COOKIES STAY ON MY BROWSING DEVICE?</p>
                <br>
                <p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or
                    "session"
                    cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay on your
                    browsing
                    device until they expire or are deleted.
                </p>

                <p class="bold">FIRST AND THIRD-PARTY COOKIES</p>
                <br>
                <p>First party cookies are cookies that belong to us, while third party cookies are cookies that another party
                    places on
                    your browsing device through our Site. For example, third party website will place a cookie on your browsing
                    device if
                    you click on such third-party website link when browsing the Site.
